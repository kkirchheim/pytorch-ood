PyTorch Out-of-Distribution Detection
==========================================

PyTorch-OOD is a PyTorch-based library that offers a range of modular,
tested, and well-documented implementations of Out-of-Distribution (OOD)
detection methods.
This library is designed to provide users with a unified interface,
pre-trained models, utility functions, and benchmark datasets
for OOD detection.

This documentation serves as a user guide, presenting
comprehensive information on the library's assumptions,
nomenclature, and structured API documentation.

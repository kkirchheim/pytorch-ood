    From the paper *Dropout as a Bayesian Approximation: Representing Model Uncertainty in Deep Learning*.
    Forward-propagates the input through the model :math:`N` times with activated dropout and averages the results.

    In ``mean`` mode, the outlier score is calculated as

    .. math:: - \\max_y \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_n^{N} \\sigma_y(f_n(x))

    where :math:`\\sigma` is the softmax function. In ``var`` mode, the scores are calculated as

    .. math::  \\frac{1}{C} \\sum_y^C \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_n^N  ( \\sigma_y(f_n(x)) - \\mu_y )^2

    where :math:`C` is the number of classes and :math:`\\mu_y` is the class mean. This is the mean over the
    per class variance, which was used in *Bayesian SegNet: Model Uncertainty in Deep Convolutional
    Encoder-Decoder Architectures for Scene Understanding*.
